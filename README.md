# Customer-Segmentation
"I just completed a project called '**Customer Segmentation using Hierarchical Clustering and k-Means Clustering**'. This involved organizing our customers into meaningful groups based on their similarities. By using a technique called hierarchical clustering and k-Means clustering, we gained valuable insights that can help tailor our services and enhance the overall customer experience. Excited about the impact this can have!
